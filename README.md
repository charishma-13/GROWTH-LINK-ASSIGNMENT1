# GROWTH-LINK-ASSIGNMENT1

This project will involve the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing
Load the Titanic dataset (e.g., from Kaggle).
Handle missing values:
Fill missing age values with median/mean based on class and gender.
Drop or impute missing cabin values strategically.
Encode categorical variables:
Convert Sex, Embarked, and Pclass into numerical features.
Normalize numerical features like Fare and Age.
2. Feature Engineering
Create new meaningful features (e.g., FamilySize = SibSp + Parch).
Convert Cabin information into a categorical feature (e.g., Deck letter).
3. Model Selection & Training
Split data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80-20 split).
Train models like:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
Use cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters.
4. Model Evaluation
Assess performance using:
Accuracy
